      "text": "An entirely new set of docking techniques had to be developed, and this was done under a project titled \"docking with a non-cooperative object.\" The station's orbit would be measured using ground-based radar, and this information would be communicated to the Soyuz, which would then plot a rendezvous course. The goal was to get the ship within 5km of the station, from which point it was deemed a manual docking was technically possible. The conclusion of those responsible for developing these new techniques were that the odds of mission success were 70 to 80 percent, after proper modifications to the Soyuz. The Soviet government accepted the risk, deeming the station too valuable to simply let it fall from orbit uncontrolled.",
